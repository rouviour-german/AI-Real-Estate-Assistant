# User Guide - AI Real Estate Assistant

## Appearance

Use the theme button (moon/sun) in the top navigation to switch between Light and Dark mode. Your
selection is saved in your browser.

## Settings

Open **Settings** from the top navigation to manage:
- **Identity**: Set the email address used to scope settings (saved locally in your browser).
- **Default Model**: Choose the provider/model used by the Assistant for responses. For local providers (e.g., Ollama), the page shows whether the runtime is reachable and includes an error hint when it is not. Use **Refresh Catalog** after starting your local runtime to re-check status.
- **Notifications**: Configure digest frequency and optional Expert Mode / product updates.

## Notifications & Digests

The AI Real Estate Assistant helps you stay on top of the market with personalized email digests.
Whether you're a homebuyer looking for your dream house or an investor monitoring market trends,
our digests provide the insights you need.

Notification settings and labels follow your selected app language. Email content is currently sent in English.
Email delivery requires SMTP configuration on the backend. If SMTP is not configured, preferences
are still saved but no emails will be sent.

### Quiet Hours
If you enable quiet hours, instant alerts that would normally be emailed immediately are queued and delivered after quiet hours end.
If you are running the system as an operator, you can confirm the current queue size via `GET /api/v1/admin/notifications-stats` (requires `X-API-Key`).
You can also confirm the backend build/runtime metadata via `GET /api/v1/admin/version` (requires `X-API-Key`).

### Consumer Digest
Designed for homebuyers and renters, the Consumer Digest highlights:
- **New Matches**: Properties matching your saved searches that were added since your last update.
- **Top Picks**: A curated selection of high-quality listings relevant to your preferences.
- **Price Drops**: Significant price reductions on properties you might be interested in.
- **Saved Search Status**: A quick summary of how many new matches each of your saved searches has found.

**Frequency**: Daily or Weekly (customizable in Settings).

### Expert Digest
Designed for investors and real estate professionals, the Expert Digest includes everything in the Consumer Digest plus:
- **Market Trends**: Directional price trends (up/down) and percentage changes for your key cities.
- **City Indices**: Average price data and inventory status for top markets.
- **YoY Analysis**: Top gaining and declining areas year-over-year.

**How to Enable**:
1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**.
2. Select your preferred **Digest Frequency** (Daily/Weekly).
3. Toggle **Expert Mode** to receive advanced market analytics.

### Managing Saved Searches
To ensure your digest contains relevant properties:
1. Use the **Search** tab to define your criteria (Location, Price, Rooms, etc.).
2. Click **Save Search** and give it a memorable name (e.g., "2-bed in Downtown").
3. These searches will automatically feed into your digest.
4. For map-based searches, you can narrow results by geo radius or a bounding box area.

## Data Sources

The Community Edition focuses on local-first workflows:
- **Local datasets**: Properties indexed in the local vector store (ChromaDB) for search and tools.
- **Optional connectors**: Some integrations are available as CE-safe webhooks/stubs and can be enabled via environment flags.
- **Optional developer features**: Some non-API helper modules may require extra Python packages and are not needed for normal UI/API usage.

## Market Analytics

Market analytics are exposed in two places:
- **Tools**: Price analysis and comparisons are available under **Analytics & Tools**.
- **Email digests** (optional): If SMTP is configured, weekly/daily digests can include an Expert section with trends.

## Exporting Data

You can export property listings and search results for offline analysis or sharing.

### Supported Formats
- **PDF**: Best for sharing and printing. Includes summary statistics and a clean table of properties.
- **Excel/CSV**: Best for further analysis in spreadsheet software.
- **JSON**: Best for developers and data integration.
- **Markdown**: Best for text-based notes and documentation.

### How to Export
1. Perform a search or view your saved properties.
2. Click the **Export** button in the sidebar or results view.
3. Select your desired format (e.g., "PDF Report").
4. The file will be generated and downloaded automatically.

## Chat Interface

The AI-powered chat interface allows you to search for properties using natural language.

### Local Run (Docker)
- Ensure Docker Desktop is installed
- Copy environment: `Copy-Item .env.example .env`
- Start: `docker compose up -d --build`
- Optional smoke (build + health checks): `python scripts\ci\compose_smoke.py --ci` (the same smoke test runs in CI; checks `/api/v1/verify-auth` when `API_ACCESS_KEY` or `API_ACCESS_KEYS` is set)
- Alternative (auto-detect Docker vs local): `.\scripts\dev\start.ps1` (more options in `docs/scripts/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`)
- Open UI: `http://localhost:3000`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- OpenAPI schema: `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` (repo snapshot: `docs/api/openapi.json`)
- Generated endpoint index (repo): `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.generated.md`

Operator note:
- Rotate/revoke API keys safely via `API_ACCESS_KEYS` (staged rotation). See `docs/SECURITY.md` for the runbook.
- For Vercel deployments, the web app expects `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/v1` and proxies server-side to `BACKEND_API_URL` (set this in Vercel env; production requires it and rejects localhost).
- CI runs security checks (Bandit + pip-audit). Local equivalents: `python -m bandit -r api agents ai analytics config data i18n models notifications rules scripts tools utils vector_store workflows -lll -iii` and `python -m pip_audit -r requirements.txt --ignore-vuln GHSA-7gcm-g887-7qv7 --ignore-vuln CVE-2026-0994`.

### How to Use
1. Navigate to the **Chat** tab.
2. Type your request (e.g., "Find me a 2-bedroom apartment in Warsaw under 3000 PLN").
3. The AI will analyze your request, search the database, and present the best matches.
4. You can ask follow-up questions or refine your criteria conversationally.

### Streaming Responses (SSE)
For real-time streaming from the assistant:
- In API mode, set `"stream": true` in `POST /api/v1/chat`
- Optional debug trace: set `"include_intermediate_steps": true` to receive a tool trace in the final `event: meta` payload.
- The response uses `text/event-stream` with message deltas as JSON lines: `data: {"content":"<text-delta>"}`
- After the assistant finishes streaming text, the server emits a final metadata event: `event: meta` with `data: {"sources":[...],"sources_truncated":false,"session_id":"..."}`
- The stream finishes with `data: [DONE]`
- For direct API calls, include the `X-API-Key` header (see API Reference). The web app proxies API calls server-side, so the browser does not embed the API key (proxy uses `API_ACCESS_KEY` or the first entry in `API_ACCESS_KEYS`; keys are trimmed and empty entries are ignored).
- Contributors: do not place API keys in public client env vars; the repo enforces this via `python scripts\security\forbidden_tokens_check.py`.
- The UI progressively renders assistant messages, shows a Retry button on errors, and displays Sources (when available)
- Sources are displayed with a human-friendly title (derived from source metadata) plus a compact metadata summary and content preview
- The UI displays `request_id` on both success and error paths (when available) to help correlate with server logs (derived from `X-Request-ID`)
- When reporting a bug to operators, include the `request_id` from the UI whenever possible.
- Sources may be truncated (count and per-item content length) to keep payloads safe for clients
- UI debug mode: open `/chat?debug=1` to render the server-provided intermediate tool trace (useful for troubleshooting web research).

## Search Filters

Use the filters sidebar on the Search page to narrow results:
- Min/Max Price: Enter numbers to constrain price range
- Minimum Rooms: Specify the minimum number of rooms
- Property Type: Choose from Apartment, House, Studio, Loft, Townhouse, Other

Tips:
- Enter a query first (the Search button is disabled until you do).
- Filters combine with your text query for hybrid ranking
- Min Price must be less than or equal to Max Price
- Click “Clear Filters” to reset and broaden results

Neutral/empty states:
- Before the first search, the page shows a neutral prompt to enter a query
- After a search with zero matches, the page shows “No results found”

### Map View
- Use the **List / Map** toggle above results to switch views.
- The map renders markers only for listings that include `latitude` and `longitude`.
- The UI shows a “mappable” count (e.g., `3 / 10`) to indicate how many results can be plotted.
- When many results are present, markers are clustered into count bubbles; zoom in to see individual properties.
- Click a cluster bubble to zoom into that area (fit-to-bounds, capped) and reveal individual markers.
- If no results include coordinates, the map view shows a “No mappable results” message.

## Geo Search

Use geo filters to target a specific area:
- Radius: provide latitude, longitude, and radius (km)
- Bounding Box: provide min/max lat and min/max lon

Example (client payload):
```json
{
  "query": "apartments with balcony",
  "lat": 50.0647,
  "lon": 19.9450,
  "radius_km": 3.0,
  "sort_by": "price",
  "sort_order": "asc"
}
```

## Sorting

Use Sorting to order results:
- Sort By: Relevance, Price, Price per m², Area (m²), Year Built
- Order: Ascending or Descending

Sorting works together with filters and semantic relevance.

## Login (Email Code)

For accounts-enabled deployments, you can log in using a one-time email code:
- Request a code: `POST /api/v1/auth/request-code` with your email
- Enter the 6-digit code to verify: `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-code`
- The server returns a `session_token`; include it in subsequent requests with `X-Session-Token`
- In development, the API returns the code inline for testing

## CORS

For local development, all origins are allowed.
For production, set:
```powershell
$env:ENVIRONMENT="production"
$env:CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="https://yourapp.com,https://studio.vercel.app"
```

**Production safety:** The backend validates that:
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is set (not empty)
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` does NOT contain wildcard `*`

If production is configured with wildcard or empty CORS origins, the application will fail to start with a clear error message. This prevents accidental deployment with overly permissive CORS.

The backend will only allow these origins.
When the API is called cross-origin from a browser, the backend exposes `X-Request-ID` via
`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` so client code can read it for support and troubleshooting.

## Quality & Stability
- The app enforces backend quality gates (lint, types, custom rules) to improve reliability.
- If requests fail due to rate limits or validation, try again after the suggested reset time.
- Contributors: run CI parity commands from `docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md` on Windows PowerShell.
- For contributors, run backend checks locally:
  - `python -m pytest`
  - `python -m pytest -q tests\integration\test_rule_engine_clean.py`
  - `python -m ruff check .`
  - `python -m mypy`

## Financial Tools

### Mortgage Calculator
Plan your budget effectively with our integrated Mortgage Calculator.

**Features**:
- **Monthly Payment**: Calculate your estimated monthly mortgage payment.
- **Total Interest**: See how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.
- **Cost Breakdown**: Visualize the split between principal and interest.

**How to Use**:
1. Navigate to the **Analytics & Tools** tab.
2. Scroll to the **Mortgage Calculator** section.
3. Enter the **Property Price**, **Down Payment**, **Interest Rate**, and **Loan Term**.
4. Click **Calculate** to view detailed results.

### Prompt Templates
Generate ready-to-use text for common real estate workflows (listing descriptions, buyer emails).

**How to Use**:
1. Navigate to the **Analytics & Tools** tab.
2. Scroll to **Prompt Templates**.
3. Pick a template (e.g., “Buyer follow-up email”).
4. Fill in the required fields (marked with `*`) and click **Generate**.
5. Copy the output and paste it into your email/client workflow.

### API Tools (V4)
If you are using the V4 API (FastAPI), the same tool capabilities are available over HTTP:
- Compare properties by IDs
- Basic price analysis for a query
- Basic location lookup for a property ID
Additional CE stub endpoints (may be disabled depending on server configuration):
- Valuation estimate: `POST /api/v1/tools/valuation` (requires `VALUATION_MODE=simple` and vector
  store available)
- Legal check: `POST /api/v1/tools/legal-check` (requires `LEGAL_CHECK_MODE=basic`)
- Data enrichment: `POST /api/v1/tools/enrich-address` (requires `DATA_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=true`)
- CRM contact sync: `POST /api/v1/tools/crm-sync-contact` (requires `CRM_WEBHOOK_URL` to be set)

### Models & Costs (V4 API)
If you are building a client that needs to display available models/providers (and token pricing where applicable):
- `GET /api/v1/settings/models` returns provider + model metadata, including context windows,
  capabilities, and pricing (when available).
In the web app, you can view this under **Settings > Models & Costs**.
For local providers (e.g., Ollama), the response includes `runtime_available` and
`available_models`, and the UI shows setup steps when the local runtime is not detected.
You can also click **Test Connection** for a local provider to run a targeted runtime check (without refreshing the whole catalog).

### API Export (V4)
To export search results or specific property IDs via the V4 API (and from the web app UI):
- `POST /api/v1/export/properties` supports `format`: `csv`, `xlsx`, `json`, `md`, `pdf`
- Web app:
  - **Search**: pick export format, optionally provide a comma-separated column list, then click **Export**
  - **Tools > Compare**: enter IDs, then click **Export** (uses the same endpoint)
- Example (export by search with sorting):
  ```json
  {
    "format": "xlsx",
    "search": {
      "query": "2 bedroom apartment in Krakow",
      "limit": 25,
      "filters": { "city": "Krakow" },
      "alpha": 0.7,
      "sort_by": "price",
      "sort_order": "asc"
    }
  }
  ```
 - Example (export by IDs with column selection + locale-friendly CSV):
  ```json
  {
    "format": "csv",
    "property_ids": ["prop1", "prop2"],
    "columns": ["id", "city", "price"],
    "include_header": true,
    "csv_delimiter": ";",
    "csv_decimal": ","
  }
  ```

## Local RAG (Community Edition)

You can upload your own notes to enable question answering over your content.

- Supported file types in CE: `.txt`, `.md`
- Supported with optional install: `.pdf` (`pip install pypdf`), `.docx` (`pip install python-docx`)
- If nothing is indexed (e.g., only PDFs without optional deps), the API returns `422` with details.
- Upload limits (max files / max bytes) are enforced by the backend; oversized files are reported in `errors`.
- If total payload exceeds the configured limit, the API returns `413` and indexes nothing.

### Using the Web App
1. Open the **Knowledge** tab in the top navigation.
2. In **Upload**, select one or more files and click **Upload**.
3. In **Ask**, enter a question and click **Ask**.
4. The answer is shown along with **Citations** (source + chunk index, plus optional PDF page / DOCX paragraph) for traceability.
5. If you want to start fresh, click **Clear knowledge** to remove all indexed documents.

### Upload Flow
1. Use a client or cURL to call `POST /api/v1/rag/upload` with form-data `files`.
2. The server chunks your documents and indexes them locally.
3. Response includes how many chunks were indexed.

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
$form = @{
  files = Get-Item .\notes.md
}

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rag/upload" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{ "X-API-Key" = "dev-secret-key" } `
  -Form $form
```

### Ask Questions
- Call `POST /api/v1/rag/qa` with a JSON body:
  ```json
  { "question": "What is Krakow known for?", "top_k": 5 }
  ```
- Optional: include `provider` / `model` to override the selection for this request.
- Response includes `answer`, `citations`, and `llm_used` (plus the effective `provider` / `model`).

Tip: If no model is configured, the API returns a snippet from the most relevant chunks.

### Reset Knowledge
If you want to remove all indexed documents without restarting the app, call `POST /api/v1/rag/reset`.
